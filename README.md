# RDP-INI
Storage of .ini files for updates
Original cources for RDP Wrapper are:
 - https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap
 - https://github.com/asmtron/rdpwrap-old
 
 rdpwrap.ini is going to be updated here for use of the 'AutoUpdater' now renamed 'RDPW - Update'
 This needs to be dropped into "C:\Program Files\RDP Wrapper" with the already existing group of RDP related files
 Ensure that a connection works with RDPCheck.exe before attempting with a tablet connection.
